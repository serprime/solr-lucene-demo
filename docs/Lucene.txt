Apache Lucene is a free open source information retrieval software library, originally written in Java by Doug Cutting. It is supported by the Apache Software Foundation and is released under the Apache Software License.
Lucene has been ported to other programming languages including Delphi, Perl, C#, C++, Python, Ruby, and PHP.

Doug Cutting originally wrote Lucene in 1999. It was initially available for download from its home at the SourceForge web site. It joined the Apache Software Foundation's Jakarta family of open-source Java products in September 2001 and became its own top-level Apache project in February 2005.
Lucene formerly included a number of sub-projects, such as Lucene.NET, Mahout, Solr and Nutch. Solr is now merged into the Lucene project itself, and Lucene.NET, Mahout, Nutch, and Tika are independent top-level projects.
Version 4.0 was released on 12 October 2012.

While suitable for any application which requires full text indexing and searching capability, Lucene has been widely recognized for its utility in the implementation of Internet search engines and local, single-site searching.
At the core of Lucene's logical architecture is the idea of a document containing fields of text. This flexibility allows Lucene's API to be independent of the file format. Text from PDFs, HTML, Microsoft Word, and OpenDocument documents, as well as many others (except images), can all be indexed as long as their textual information can be extracted.
