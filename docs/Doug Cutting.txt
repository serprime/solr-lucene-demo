Douglass Read "Doug" Cutting is an advocate and creator of
open­source search technology. He originated Lucene and, with
Mike Cafarella, Nutch, both open­source search technology projects
which are now managed through the Apache Software Foundation.
He is also the creator of Hadoop.

He holds a bachelor's degree from Stanford University.
Prior to developing Lucene, Doug held search technology positions at Excite, Apple Inc. and Xerox PARC.

Lucene, a search indexer, and Nutch, a spider or crawler, are the two key components of an open­source
general search platform, which first crawls the Web for content, and then structures it into a searchable
index. Cutting's leadership of these two projects extended the concepts and capabilities of general opensource
software projects such as Linux and MySQL into the important vertical domain of search. While it is
difficult to track the total number of installations of these platforms, public announcements of the use of
Lucene and its direct descendant Solr by various venture­backed startups indicate a significant level of
adoption. Perhaps the most significant deployment of Lucene is Wikipedia, where it powers search for the
entire site.

In December 2004, Google Labs published a paper on the MapReduce algorithm, which allows very large
scale computations to be trivially parallelized across large clusters of servers. Cutting, realizing the
importance of this paper to extending Lucene into the realm of extremely large search problems, created the
open­source Hadoop framework that allows applications based on the MapReduce paradigm to be run on
large clusters of commodity hardware. Cutting was an employee of Yahoo!, where he led the Hadoop
project full­time; he has since moved on to Cloudera.

In July 2009, Doug Cutting was elected to the board of directors of the Apache Software Foundation, and in
September 2010, he was elected its chairman.
